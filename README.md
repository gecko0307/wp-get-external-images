# Get External Images

A very simple WordPress plugin that imports external images in posts (automatically downloads them to the Media Library and updates URLs in posts). It is useful after migrating from another CMS when images in posts still link to the old site.

Images that are already in the library are ignored. Draft posts are ignored.

Plugin was tested with WordPress 6.8.

## Usage

Before starting, make a backup of the database. There are plenty of great plugins to do that.

Go to the "Get External Images" section in the admin panel, then press the "Start import" button. The progressbar will show a number of posts processed.
